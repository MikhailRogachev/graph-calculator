# Simple Graph Calculator and Plotter

The main goal of this application is to allow users to interactively observe the behavior of Sine, Cosine, and Sinc
functions.

It will provide a tool for calculating and 2D visualizing these functions, allowing users to manipulate parameters
and observe the resulting changes in the graphs. 

The results of the observation can be saved in vector format.

## Solution
To achieve this goal, a WPF application named “Simple Graph Calculator and Plotter” must be developed. This
application will be designed using the MVVM pattern and will contain a control panel for functions and
parameters, as well as a plotting area for the graphs.
